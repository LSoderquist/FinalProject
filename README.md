# FinalProject

My project team consists of only myself. For my project I will be creating a data structure to represent airports and the different planes at each one. The airports will be represented by vertices on a graph, and each graph will have a linked list attribute that contains a list of all planes currently at that airport. The edges between the vertices of the graph will represent the distances between the airports. Additionally, each plane will have a certain amount of fuel that will decrease as it flies between airports. Various public methods I will create include methods to get the shortest pathways between two airports, determine whether it is possible for a plane with a certain amount of fuel to travel from one airport to another, add vertices, add edges, add planes, fuel planes, getter methods for various pieces of data, and more.
